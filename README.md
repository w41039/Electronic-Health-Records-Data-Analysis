# STAT3612

In this project, I processed the data and designed statistical machine learning models for two risk prediction tasks. Numerous machine learning methods, including liner regression, logistic regression, KNN, SVM, Adaboost and gradient boost are used to analyse the data. Performance of different models are compared and effect of different factors on the prediction is analysed. 

# Background 
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) holds the potential to improve healthcare in many ways, such as delivering better patient treatments, improving hospital operations, and answering fundamental scientific questions. As the development of modern healthcare systems, a promising application of EHRs is designing machine learning models
for risk prediction tasks, like mortality and long Length-of-stay (LOS) prediction. 

# Dataset
MIMIC-III is a well-known public de-identified EHR database, which contains information of 53423 patients admitted to critical care units at a Boston-area hospital from 2001-2012.

# Task 1
Mortality Prediction: Predict the patients’ mortality status (binary classification) given clinically grouped time-varying labs and
vitals features.

# Task 2
Length-of-stay (LOS) Prediction: Predict the patients’ length of staying in ICU (regression) given clinically grouped time-varying labs and
vitals features
